RESEARCH PHASE
1. Search GitHub for Existing Projects
I will search GitHub for repositories using these terms:

"poe.com scraper"
"poe api python"
"poe conversation export"
"poe automation"
I’ll look for:

Poe.com scrapers
Poe API clients (official or reverse-engineered)
Python libraries for Poe.com automation
2. Analyze Existing Solutions
For the most starred/recent repos, I’ll review:

Their scraping approach (Selenium, requests, API, etc.)
How they handle authentication, rate limiting, pagination
Code quality, maintenance, and documentation
Limitations (e.g., partial export, anti-bot issues)
INTEGRATION STRATEGY
3. Choose the Best Approach
If a robust project exists: Fork/integrate it
If partial solutions: Combine approaches
If none: Build from scratch using best practices
Consider hybrid (existing + custom)
TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS
4. Core Functionality
Poe.com authentication (cookies/tokens)
Discover all conversations (pagination)
Extract full history: messages, timestamps, bot names, titles, IDs
Handle rate limiting/anti-bot
Resume interrupted sessions
Export: JSON, CSV, SQLite
5. Database Design
SQLite (local, portable)
Tables: conversations, messages, bots, users
Indexing for fast search
Support threading
Metadata (scrape time, bot version, etc.)
6. Python Tech Stack
Selenium WebDriver (browser automation)
requests/httpx (API calls)
SQLAlchemy (ORM)
BeautifulSoup (HTML parsing)
asyncio (concurrency)
Rich/tqdm (progress/logging)
Click (CLI)
IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
7. Code Structure
I’ll research existing solutions first, then propose a code structure based on the best approach. Next, I’ll begin implementation.

Starting with GitHub research for Poe.com scrapers and automation tools.

## Implementation Phases Log

### Phase 1: Research & Analysis
- [x] Searched GitHub for Poe.com scrapers and related projects
- [x] Documented findings in `docs/research-log.md` and `docs/github-research.md`
- [x] Noted additional resource: [poe-search](https://github.com/hkevin01/poe-search)
- [x] Analyzed project structure and main files of referenced scrapers
- [x] Selected integration strategy: hybrid (existing + custom enhancements)

### Phase 2: Project Restructuring
- [x] Created logical directories: src, tests, docs, scripts, data, assets, .github, .copilot, .vscode
- [x] Updated .gitignore to exclude venv and other files
- [x] Created Python virtual environment
- [x] Added initial scripts for testing, formatting, linting
- [x] Added CI workflow, templates, codeowners, contributing, and security files

### Phase 3: Modernization & Refactoring
- [ ] Migrate and refactor code from referenced scraper projects into src
- [ ] Update code to Python 3.x standards and best practices
- [ ] Remove deprecated and redundant code
- [ ] Add comments and docstrings
- [ ] Ensure modularity and maintainability

### Phase 4: Documentation
- [x] Created project plan, workflow, goals, changelog, and documentation stubs
- [ ] Add README.md with overview, installation, usage, contribution, license
- [ ] Add detailed docs for architecture, API, usage

### Phase 5: Automation & Tooling
- [x] Added CI/CD workflow and scripts for automation
- [ ] Integrate additional tools as needed
- [ ] Finalize and test all automation
