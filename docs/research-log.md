# Poe.com Scraper Research Log

## 2025-07-24

### Initial User Request
- Build a comprehensive Poe.com conversation scraper to extract all user conversations and store them in a database.
- Systematic approach outlined:
  1. Research existing solutions on GitHub
  2. Analyze approaches and limitations
  3. Choose best integration strategy
  4. Define core functionality
  5. Design SQLite database schema
  6. Use Python tech stack (Selenium, requests/httpx, SQLAlchemy, BeautifulSoup, asyncio, Rich/tqdm, Click)
  7. Plan code structure

### Actions Taken
- Attempted to search GitHub for existing Poe.com scrapers and automation tools using various queries.
- Encountered tool limitations: GitHub code search requires a specific repository name, not general search terms.
- Proposed alternative: Use semantic search in workspace and provide manual GitHub research instructions if needed.
- User requested to keep a log of all actions and suggestions in markdown files in the `docs` folder.

## Additional Resource Considered
- [poe-search](https://github.com/hkevin01/poe-search): This repository was reviewed as a potential resource for search and data extraction functionality related to Poe.com. Its approaches and code may be integrated or referenced for advanced features in this project.

### Next Steps
- Perform semantic search in workspace for relevant code or documentation.
- Continue research and log all findings and suggestions.
