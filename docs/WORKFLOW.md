# Development Workflow

## Branching Strategy

- Create feature branches for new features
- Use pull requests for merging

## CI/CD Pipelines
- Automated testing on push and pull requests
- Linting and formatting checks
- Deployment to production on merge to main

## Code Review
- All code changes require review
- Use GitHub pull requests
- Address review comments before merging
